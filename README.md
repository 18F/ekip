Hello. 

The EKIP application is now a single Django application, run out of the
https://github.com/18F/ekip-api repository. 

This repository is now used only for issues, and tracking our sprints (as it
was before the change to a single application). 


#### History

The EKIP application used to consist of two parts: a Django based API, and a
Jekyll application.  We've now moved to a single Django application for
simplicity, and the fact that the Jekyll application would have required
Javascript.
